# Getting Started

This project is using Docker to turn development easier, so to start it just copy and paste in root directory the dotenv file in `_setup/example.env` and rename it to `.env` after paste. After it, fill out fields with values you got and settings are ready.

Next step is just run project using `docker compose up` or run manually using `yarn dev`!

```shell
# Docker
docker compose up

# manually
yarn
yarn dev
```
